Please transcribe all handwritten text from this image in Markdown format.

Instructions:
- Extract ALL visible handwritten text, including notes, arrows, symbols, and annotations
- Format the output as clean Markdown with proper structure
- Use ## for main headings, ### for subheadings
- For arrows, use → ← ↑ ↓ symbols
- For bullet points, use - (dash) for bullets, NOT asterisks
- For checkboxes, use - [ ] for empty and - [x] for checked
- Use **bold** for emphasis where appropriate
- Use `code` for any technical terms or special notation
- Maintain line breaks and logical structure

IMPORTANT - Date Detection:
Look specifically on the RIGHT SIDE of the page at any height for dates in format dd-mm-yyyy that might be surrounded by a "lying L" or bracket-like shape (⌐ or similar). These dates are typically positioned at the same height as underlined titles. This is crucial for organizing the content chronologically.

If you find a date on the right side:
- Start your transcription with: "**Date: dd-mm-yyyy**"
- Then add a horizontal rule: "---"
- Then proceed with the content

Output Format:
1. If date found: **Date: dd-mm-yyyy**\n---\n[content]
2. If no date: Just the content in Markdown format

Return only the formatted Markdown text, no explanations.
